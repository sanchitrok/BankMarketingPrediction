# BankMarketingPrediction
Cleaned the dataset and performed EDA to understand relationship between different variables with respect to target variable  whether a customer will deposit money or not. Fitted Decision Tree model using post pruning to handle Overfitting issue and calculated accuracy using confusion matrix as well as built visualization for training set and test set based on the prediction made. Applied Random Forest model and using confusion matrix checked accuracy for prediction made also generated visualization for test set based on underlying prediction and improved accuracy by ~5% from decision tree model prediction
